circuit 1 (smart lighting and conditioning inside the tunnel based on object distance)
1- install arduino IDE
2- update and install ardino uno board
3- connect circuit as shown in pcb 
4- copy code provided by github
5- run simulaion
***you can also use tinkercad for simulating poject components ( arduino uno - ultrasonic sensor )
1- sign up for tinkercad website
2- choose new icon then choose circuit sub icon 
3- in search icon choose arduino uno r3 and 6 ultrasonic sensor 4 pins(HC-SR04)
4- choose code icon then code style using text only (copy text code provided by github)
5- start simulation

circuit 2 (water level indication)
1- open simulation circuit software ( proteus - multism -...)
2- place 3 NPN (2N222) transistors and 3 different LEDs (Red-Green-Blue) for different water levels
3- connect +ve terminal led to -ve terminal NPN 
4- connect -ve terminal led to +ve terminal battery of 5 volt DC
5- connect -ve terminal battery to -ve terminal transistor 
6- connect end terminal ressistor to +ve input terminal of NPN 
7- connect input terminal ressistor to water to indicate level
